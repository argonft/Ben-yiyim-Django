## About Project
Ben Ä°yiyim (I'm Well) is developed as an easy-usage application to reach and update information about people who is in current earthquake area. Also we frequently add the data that is coming from State Hospitals to our database. 

First focus of this project is to create a platform that can even be used with minimum internet connection. We developed the frontend of this app with pure HTML, Javascript and CSS just to reduce the file size. We used Django and PostgreSQL for backend.
